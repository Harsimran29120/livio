        <h1>LOGO</h1> <br>
        <div class=" details-container">
          <p style="margin-left: 18px; margin-right: 18px;">The logo was inspired by a scene from the episode: _silver mouse_ from midnight gospel. A Netflix series made by Australian director Pendleton Ward. In this episode there is a particular scene that refers to a NASA theory. This theory predicts that in 4 or 5 billion years from now the sun will have reached such an expansion as to swallow up the surrounding planets, including planet Earth. This surprising scene sees a mother talking to her son about the meaning of life and death at the exact moment when the sun is swallowing up everything around it. In these last moments all the mother's wisdom is revealed which lies in grasping one's existence with awareness, turning towards this thing called "death". The mother states that even if we are afraid she does not want to harm us, but on the contrary has a lot to teach (the dissolution of the ego as one of the most important things for example) and that she is an exceptional teacher of life. It teaches you that you have to abandon yourself to the flow, in doing so the exciting thing is that you end up discovering that this thing called death is called love on the contrary, and how encouraging it is and how it can support us. Furthermore, how great is the quality of benevolence that we may never have noticed, and it is precisely here, that before being completely absorbed by the black hole, she greets her son with the belief that even if we abandon this plane of existence, love will not go away Nowhere. The logo I created was in fact an open heart (symbolizing the dissolution of the ego) connected to a vortex (symbolizing the black hole that swallows physical existence), uniting it with the concept of infinity.
